<h1>
   YoonJi's website review assignment
</h1>
    Below are my reviews for my three websites!
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3> Review 1 on I Stand Between  </h3>
        </li>
        <a href= "https://istandbetween.mengwencao.com/"> I Stand Between </a> <br/>
    When I first went into this website, I felt it was very aesthetically pretty to skim through.
        The moving pictures at first were very cute, and I was appealed to their layout. <br/>
        I didn't know that a click on each image would take me to an another section,
        because I scrolled the page down first. I liked how each page went by very smoothly, <br/>
        as if I was looking at a presentation with an animation effect, and very slowly changing as well.
        (It gave me an ease when I scrolled down). <br/>
        I liked how it had an image of the person as well as an illustration, and a text of handwritten letters. <br/>
        It is interesting how all of these people share a similarity from the fact  that they are adopted,
        but the layouts for each of them  is styled differently, as if they were describing the person's personality. <br/>
        But personally, I do not like having audios on websites and having to listen to them, because I prefer reading texts much better. <br/>
        And the concept is a very dark themed, which I will not likely to go check out nor find out on my own time if it hadn't been an assignment. <br/>
        Overall, I like the aesthetic of the website and its motions of swipe.

        <li>
            <h3> Review 2 on The Last Generation </h3>
        </li>
        <a href="http://apps.frontline.org/the-last-generation/"> The Last Generation </a> <br/>
        Probably the most spookiest, and darkest website out of all three. It gave me a hard time to control the website, because there were only videos but no buttons. <br/>
        But I understood that I could scroll down for a next video, and the texts as well. I really liked how texts were changing on a same scene by scrolling down, (only the textbox was changing)<br/>
        and the space bar key worked as well. It really gave me a feeling of playing a game, or watching the black mirror bandersnatch. <br/>
        It gave me an option to choose a kid, and watch their lives. I wondered how the website kept the video playing in the back, yet having texts change. <br/>
        Again, I felt like I was watching presentation slides, and noticed that ABOUT THIS PROJECT information appeared from right side of the page. <br/>
        The motion wasn't just like one second change, it was about 2 seconds to let it cover the screen. </br>
        A new experiment of discovering a website with just videos, and displaying information over videos.

        <li>
            <h3> Review 3 on Open This Window</h3>
        </li>
        <a href="http://openthiswindow.com/"> Open This Window</a> <br/>
        I would never find this website on my own, or even know about it. I first like its url, how it is very simple and conveys literally what the website is. <br/>
        For those websites like Open This Window, or trying trying.com, I feel URLS matter a lot, as they don't contain texts at all. </br>
        I like how the bird sound increases as I opened the window wider, and really curious of how it is made. </br>
        Not forgetting the sound of pushing the window and the blurriness, which I appreciate its detailed parts. </br>
        I tried also on my ipad, and on my phone but the sound only came out on laptops. </br>
        I love the concept, and even my roommate who was sitting next to me wanted to explore this website, but I just wish it had more visuals when I opened the window. </br>
        For example, having some birds flying or flowers blooming or any trees or plants. I think this website is mainly for auditory sense, and </br>
        the user's experience of opening the window but nothing else.
