<h3> 1.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? <br/>
    This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication. <br/> </h3>
The advantages are that visual language and oral language is very natural to our living right now, that multisensorial is spreading and becoming an essential element of our life. <br/>
So unlike before, where everything was conveyed in textual forms, nowadays we have . Included a lot of senses that we could collect the same information but maybe in a more attractive way, or an easier way to perceive. <br/>
So, the pros are that they are more fun, interactive, and maybe more memorable, for example: it is better to see a color “black” visually, than having to read how the color “black” is literally. <br/>
However, the cons are that because they have become just a big part, that now we started to exclude the textual parts, like as if it is considered unnecessary, which lacks originally and could convey misinformation. <br/>

<h3> 2. As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? <br/>
    Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years? <br/> </h3>

In the perspective of looking at the future of literacy, Butler asks a question if literacy, the ability to read and write is no longer important, or considered necessary for the majority of the people in the future, since information can be spoken verbally, or delivered visually through web. <br/>

At first, I thought that question was a non-sense, because I think literacy will be always considered as something as a top priority, not even an option to even consider if people should learn how to read and write or not. <br/>
But after reading the introduction part, where the people discuss how difficult and hard it was to learn to read and write, I felt like I was lucky enough to think reading and writing is a normal thing that everyone could do it. <br/>
Anyways, back to the question, Burstein replies first, by saying that he recently was reading an essay that mentions on how reading is actually very difficult. <br/>
The author of the essay, Spider Robinson, talks about his encounter to a piece of stone that had “Tood and Janey forever” written, which he felt unfortunate for “Todd” not knowing how to spell his own name <br/>
Also, Robinson also talks about how the society now has become so much easier to receive information through television or radio, because it is much less decoding to do while understanding, whereas reading requires a full-decoding and the knowledge to understand in order to get the information. <br/>
I really wonder, that now visual language and design is an required element in every parts of our life, people possible could, not take reading and writing necessary as they can just easily absorb visually-presented information or orally. <br/>
Michael Mcafee answers to this question in an very original way, that since language itself was developed from the necessity to put down the symbols, as well as the requirement to decode the symbols, whether to communicate with people or to receive information, literacy is somewhat needed for the next generation. <br/>
But he says that it is possible for just for some certain people, another language or slang terms could be used in need to communicate. <br/>
Craig mentions how there would be disparity between those who can read and write, will be controlling the information flow, and continues to develop more on what Michael said, that small societies and having their own ways to communicate would possible be used to control segments of the society later on. <br/>
But Alan Wexelblat poses something different than the others, saying that he sees the future with less importance of literacy, due to new technologies that will rise and participating into our new culture. <br/>
Like a new parallel language, that includes textual language, but also pictorial language for those who can’t read. <br/>
<br/>
So to conclude the question, I think literacy is being devalued on web, as people desire more to see visually, and more audios to hear because it is easier to be collected and to be perceived, rather than having to read and decode the symbols on the web. <br/>
However, in order to have all the visuals and the audios on the web, literacy is however needed, in order to build the whole information up from the scratch, for example, someone who knows how to read and write, will be able to build websites and code that shows pictures and sounds to the users. <br/>
And for whoever the person wants this to be passed on, the method has to be written, in order for the next person to learn and see how the process works. <br/>

<h3> 3. How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? <br/> Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold true within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements? <br/>
</h3>

<br/>
Hypertext was a major innovation when it appeared, as users could easily find out more about the context that would lead you to another page. <br/>
However, Delany does criticize the differences between having to interact physically and interacting virtually on computer screens. <br/>
He takes an example of going to a gallery, observing a piece of work to a next one, and the energy you spend on interacting that pictures is much larger than having to click on multiple images on computer screens. <br/>
Although they are the same artworks showing, the amount of energy and the feelings of interacting is very different, and doing it physically is obviously much greater than experiencing virtually. <br/>
The concept of hypertext, to give more ease in interacting, and to be fast and be a way of short-cut in putting the energy, is absolutely less interactive, therefore cannot deliver as much as how much physical interactions can. <br/>
Hypertext limits the amount of interactivity, but also limits the chances and the places you can reach out too. <br/>
It could cut down experiences that you could explore even more when doing them physically, but hypertext really cuts that down and shows only the required information, which is a limitation. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made?<br/> </h3>
<br/>
I think in terms of literacy being unnecessary in the future, I read comments in the conversations that someone from the past said literacy would become no longer important and precious as it was considered in the early stage. <br/>
I think partially that statement is true in nowadays, since it is currently disappearing. <br/>
But this doesn’t relate to the lack of education in reading or writing, it’s that people don’t bother to get themselves educated to know in reading and writing, when there are other ways that they could easily understand and receive information. <br/>
Because also our society is moving and starts to produce people who don’t want to read nor want to have an experience, it isn’t the problem of spreading literacy, but rather the flow change of people’s mind of being aware of reading and writing. <br/>
