<h4> The Web's Grain Reading Assignment </h4>
<div class="text">
    After I started to take coding class, I realized how important and significant keeping the screen size is. <br/>
    I have always treated as a normal feature, whereas in the process of making it was a real difficult step, and a lot to consider. <br/>
    But how hard would it be adding images, and having text messages on the side? Or next to it? Or along with it?<br/>
    I like how this reading helps me to think visually, because sometimes from the previous readings it was hard for me to follow up <br/>
    but the author was saying, but then this guy added  videos of screen recordings so I know what he is talking about; (since css tools are hard to be literally explained)
    SO I think the main point of this reading, well the main point the author is arguing is “let’s switch our mind from web design being a blank canvas we can draw in -> <br/>
    to material to build with to reach our purpose” When he took an example of Hockney’s portraits with polaroid, I was really excited because my favorite painter is Hockney, <br/>
    and I wrote a really long essay on his projects using photocopier and his method of adding cubism into his work.<br/>
    I got some inspirations on what to do for my assignment for next week coding class, by looking at Hockney’s pieces that are overlaid and stacked. <br/>
    What the author had described for Hockney’s work wraps up perfectly and gave me literal inspirations for our mini collage inspirations; yet I still don't know how to start.  <br/>
    This reading sort of guides you on what to start- says it is better to come up with visual arrangements first so you know which elements and where the placements should be at. <br/>
    I learned of what responsive, and interactive design is, and figured it is something that I want to learn, <br/>
    and be good at, because they don’t bore you at all;and it is needed in nearly everything. Web design may have felt to be overwhelming, <br/>
    and complex that it is just too much- but practically it was something that could set the border line and make everything simplified. <br/>
    It can hide and organize information in a form that users want them to be and make things just much easier to follow up when having the most information.
